This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Exercise on Web Api.
Your challenge is to use the Star Wars API.

Using this API, build a single page application that uses fetch() to retrieve information and display it on your website. Once done, share your project on github folder with me if you would like. I will be featuring my favourites in an upcoming video!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
